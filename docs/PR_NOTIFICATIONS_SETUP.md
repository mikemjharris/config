# PR Comment Notifications Setup

This workflow monitors PR comments and approvals across all your GitHub repositories and sends notifications to Slack.

## Features

- **Mentions**: Get notified when someone mentions you in a PR comment
- **Comments on your PRs**: Track all non-bot comments on PRs you created
- **Approvals**: Know when your PRs get approved
- **Bot filtering**: Automatically excludes comments from bots
- **Hourly checks**: Runs every hour to keep you updated

## Setup

### 1. Create a Slack Webhook

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "Incoming Webhooks"
4. Activate incoming webhooks
5. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
6. Select the channel where you want notifications
7. Copy the webhook URL

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your repository:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Add these secrets:

   - **SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL**: The webhook URL from step 1
   - **PAT_TOKEN** (optional): A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
     - If not provided, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used
     - A PAT is recommended for accessing private repos and organizations
     - Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### 3. Enable the Workflow

The workflow is already configured in `.github/workflows/pr-comment-notifications.yml`

It will:
- Run automatically every hour
- Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab

### 4. Test It

You can test the workflow manually:

1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "PR Comment Notifications"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check your Slack channel for the notification

## Customization

### Change Schedule

Edit `.github/workflows/pr-comment-notifications.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run every hour (current setting)
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

    # Or run every 30 minutes
    # - cron: '*/30 * * * *'

    # Or run every 3 hours
    # - cron: '0 */3 * * *'

    # Or run at 9am and 5pm UTC (adjust for your timezone)
    # - cron: '0 9,17 * * *'
```

### Adjust Time Window

The script checks for activity in the last 70 minutes (to account for cron timing).

To change this, edit `scripts/check-pr-comments.py`:

```python
# Around line 36, change minutes=70 to your preferred value
self.since = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=70)
```

### Filter Specific Repos

If you want to exclude certain repos, modify the `get_all_repos()` method in the script to filter them out.

## Troubleshooting

### No notifications received

1. Check that the workflow ran successfully in the Actions tab
2. Verify your Slack webhook URL is correct
3. Ensure you have PR activity in the last hour
4. Try running the workflow manually to test

### Missing comments

1. Verify the PAT_TOKEN has access to all your repos
2. Check that comments are within the time window (last 70 minutes by default)
3. Ensure comments aren't from bots (they're filtered out)

### Rate limiting

If you have many repositories, you might hit GitHub API rate limits:
- With `GITHUB_TOKEN`: 1,000 requests/hour
- With `PAT_TOKEN`: 5,000 requests/hour

Consider adjusting the schedule to run less frequently if needed.
